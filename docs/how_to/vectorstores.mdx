# 如何创建和查询向量存储

:::info
前往 [集成](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) 查看与第三方向量存储的内置集成文档。

存储和搜索非结构化数据的最常见方法之一是将其嵌入并存储生成的嵌入向量，
然后在查询时嵌入非结构化查询并检索与嵌入查询“最相似”的嵌入向量。
向量存储负责存储嵌入数据并执行向量搜索，
为您处理这些。

## 开始使用

本指南展示了与向量存储相关的基本功能。使用向量存储的关键部分是创建要放入其中的向量，
通常通过嵌入创建。因此，建议您在深入了解之前，先熟悉 [文本嵌入模型接口](/docs/how_to/embed_text)。

在使用向量存储之前，我们需要加载一些数据并初始化嵌入模型。

我们想使用OpenAI嵌入模型，因此我们必须获取OpenAI API密钥。

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

# Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store.
raw_documents = TextLoader('state_of_the_union.txt').load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)
```

有许多优秀的向量存储选项，以下是一些免费的、开源的，并且完全在本地机器上运行的选项。查看所有集成以获取许多优秀的托管服务。


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="chroma" label="Chroma" default>

本教程使用 `chroma` 向量数据库，它作为库在本地机器上运行。

```bash
pip install langchain-chroma
```

```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma

db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="faiss" label="FAISS">

本教程使用 `FAISS` 向量数据库，它利用了 Facebook AI 相似性搜索 (FAISS) 库。

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu
```

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS

db = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="lance" label="Lance">

本笔记本展示了如何使用与基于 Lance 数据格式的 LanceDB 向量数据库相关的功能。

```bash
pip install lancedb
```

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import LanceDB

import lancedb

db = lancedb.connect("/tmp/lancedb")
table = db.create_table(
    "my_table",
    data=[
        {
            "vector": embeddings.embed_query("Hello World"),
            "text": "Hello World",
            "id": "1",
        }
    ],
    mode="overwrite",
)
db = LanceDB.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 相似性搜索

所有向量存储都暴露了 `similarity_search` 方法。
这将接收传入的文档，创建它们的嵌入，然后找到所有具有最相似嵌入的文档。

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
```


### 按向量进行相似性搜索

也可以使用 `similarity_search_by_vector` 搜索与给定嵌入向量相似的文档，该方法接受嵌入向量作为参数，而不是字符串。

```python
embedding_vector = OpenAIEmbeddings().embed_query(query)
docs = db.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding_vector)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
```


## 异步操作


向量存储通常作为一个单独的服务运行，需要一些IO操作，因此它们可能会被异步调用。这带来了性能上的好处，因为你不会浪费时间等待外部服务的响应。如果你使用异步框架，例如[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)，这也可能很重要。

LangChain支持在向量存储上进行异步操作。所有方法都可以使用其异步对应方法调用，前缀为`a`，表示`async`。

```python
docs = await db.asimilarity_search(query)
docs
```

```output
