# 如何在子链之间进行路由

:::info Prerequisites

本指南假设您熟悉以下概念：
- [LangChain表达式 (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language)
- [链接可运行组件](/docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [在运行时配置链参数](/docs/how_to/configure)
- [提示词模板](/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates)
- [聊天消息](/docs/concepts/#message-types)

:::

路由允许您创建非确定性链，其中前一步的输出定义了下一步。路由可以通过允许您定义状态并使用与这些状态相关的信息作为模型调用的上下文，帮助提供与模型交互的结构和一致性。

有两种方式可以执行路由：

1. 从 [`RunnableLambda`](/docs/how_to/functions) 有条件地返回可运行组件（推荐）
2. 使用 `RunnableBranch` (遗留版)

我们将通过一个两步序列来说明这两种方法，其中第一步将输入问题分类为关于 `LangChain`、`Anthropic` 或 `其他`，然后路由到相应的提示链。

## 示例设置
首先，让我们创建一个链，以识别传入的问题是关于 `LangChain`、`Anthropic` 还是 `其他`：


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ChatAnthropic", "source": "langchain_anthropic", "docs": "https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/anthropic/chat_models/langchain_anthropic.chat_models.ChatAnthropic.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}, {"imported": "StrOutputParser", "source": "langchain_core.output_parsers", "docs": "https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/output_parsers/langchain_core.output_parsers.string.StrOutputParser.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}, {"imported": "PromptTemplate", "source": "langchain_core.prompts", "docs": "https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.prompt.PromptTemplate.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}]-->
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

chain = (
    PromptTemplate.from_template(
        """Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

Do not respond with more than one word.

<question>
{question}
</question>

Classification:"""
    )
    | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
    | StrOutputParser()
)

chain.invoke({"question": "how do I call Anthropic?"})
```



```output
'Anthropic'
```


现在，让我们创建三个子链：


```python
langchain_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are an expert in langchain. \
Always answer questions starting with "As Harrison Chase told me". \
Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
anthropic_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are an expert in anthropic. \
Always answer questions starting with "As Dario Amodei told me". \
Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
general_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
```

## 使用自定义函数（推荐）

您还可以使用自定义函数在不同输出之间进行路由。以下是一个示例：


```python
def route(info):
    if "anthropic" in info["topic"].lower():
        return anthropic_chain
    elif "langchain" in info["topic"].lower():
        return langchain_chain
    else:
        return general_chain
```


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "RunnableLambda", "source": "langchain_core.runnables", "docs": "https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableLambda.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}]-->
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

full_chain = {"topic": chain, "question": lambda x: x["question"]} | RunnableLambda(
    route
)
```


```python
full_chain.invoke({"question": "how do I use Anthropic?"})
```

```


## 使用 RunnableBranch

`RunnableBranch` 是一种特殊类型的可运行对象，允许您根据输入定义一组条件和可运行对象。它并不提供您无法在上述自定义函数中实现的功能，因此我们建议使用自定义函数。

`RunnableBranch` 通过一组（条件，可运行对象）对和一个默认可运行对象进行初始化。它通过将每个条件与调用时的输入进行比较来选择哪个分支。它选择第一个评估为 True 的条件，并使用输入运行与该条件对应的可运行对象。

如果没有提供的条件匹配，它将运行默认可运行对象。

以下是它在实际操作中的示例：


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "RunnableBranch", "source": "langchain_core.runnables", "docs": "https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.branch.RunnableBranch.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}]-->
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableBranch

branch = RunnableBranch(
    (lambda x: "anthropic" in x["topic"].lower(), anthropic_chain),
    (lambda x: "langchain" in x["topic"].lower(), langchain_chain),
    general_chain,
)
full_chain = {"topic": chain, "question": lambda x: x["question"]} | branch

## 通过语义相似性进行路由

一种特别有用的技术是使用嵌入将查询路由到最相关的提示。以下是一个示例。


```python

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
prompt_templates = [physics_template, math_template]
prompt_embeddings = embeddings.embed_documents(prompt_templates)


def prompt_router(input):
    query_embedding = embeddings.embed_query(input["query"])
    similarity = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], prompt_embeddings)[0]
    most_similar = prompt_templates[similarity.argmax()]
    print("Using MATH" if most_similar == math_template else "Using PHYSICS")
    return PromptTemplate.from_template(most_similar)


chain = (
    {"query": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | RunnableLambda(prompt_router)
    | ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```


```python
print(chain.invoke("What's a black hole"))
```
```output
Using PHYSICS
As a physics professor, I would be happy to provide a concise and easy-to-understand explanation of what a black hole is.

A black hole is an incredibly dense region of space-time where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This means that if you were to get too close to a black hole, you would be pulled in and crushed by the intense gravitational forces.

The formation of a black hole occurs when a massive star, much larger than our Sun, reaches the end of its life and collapses in on itself. This collapse causes the matter to become extremely dense, and the gravitational force becomes so strong that it creates a point of no return, known as the event horizon.

Beyond the event horizon, the laws of physics as we know them break down, and the intense gravitational forces create a singularity, which is a point of infinite density and curvature in space-time.

Black holes are fascinating and mysterious objects, and there is still much to be learned about their properties and behavior. If I were unsure about any specific details or aspects of black holes, I would readily admit that I do not have a complete understanding and would encourage further research and investigation.
```

```python
print(chain.invoke("What's a path integral"))
```
```output
Using MATH
A path integral is a powerful mathematical concept in physics, particularly in the field of quantum mechanics. It was developed by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman as an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics.

In a path integral, instead of considering a single, definite path that a particle might take from one point to another, as in classical mechanics, the particle is considered to take all possible paths simultaneously. Each path is assigned a complex-valued weight, and the total probability amplitude for the particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing (integrating) over all possible paths.

The key ideas behind the path integral formulation are:

1. Superposition principle: In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition of multiple states or paths simultaneously.

2. Probability amplitude: The probability amplitude for a particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing the complex-valued weights of all possible paths.

3. Weighting of paths: Each path is assigned a weight based on the action (the time integral of the Lagrangian) along that path. Paths with lower action have a greater weight.

4. Feynman's approach: Feynman developed the path integral formulation as an alternative to the traditional wave function approach in quantum mechanics, providing a more intuitive and conceptual understanding of quantum phenomena.

The path integral approach is particularly useful in quantum field theory, where it provides a powerful framework for calculating transition probabilities and understanding the behavior of quantum systems. It has also found applications in various areas of physics, such as condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and even in finance (the path integral approach to option pricing).

The mathematical construction of the path integral involves the use of advanced concepts from functional analysis and measure theory, making it a powerful and sophisticated tool in the physicist's arsenal.
