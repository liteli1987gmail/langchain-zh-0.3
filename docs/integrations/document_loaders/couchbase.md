# Couchbase

>[Couchbase](http://couchbase.com/) 是一个屡获殊荣的分布式 NoSQL 云数据库，提供无与伦比的多功能性、性能、可扩展性和财务价值，适用于您的所有云、移动、人工智能和边缘计算应用。


## 安装


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  couchbase
```

## 从Couchbase查询文档
有关连接到Couchbase集群的更多详细信息，请查看[Python SDK文档](https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#connection-strings)。

有关使用SQL++（JSON的SQL）查询文档的帮助，请查看[文档](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/index.html)。


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "CouchbaseLoader", "source": "langchain_community.document_loaders.couchbase", "docs": "https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.couchbase.CouchbaseLoader.html", "title": "Couchbase"}]-->
from langchain_community.document_loaders.couchbase import CouchbaseLoader

connection_string = "couchbase://localhost"  # valid Couchbase connection string
db_username = (
    "Administrator"  # valid database user with read access to the bucket being queried
)
db_password = "Password"  # password for the database user

# query is a valid SQL++ query
query = """
    SELECT h.* FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel h 
        WHERE h.country = 'United States'
        LIMIT 1
        """
```

## 创建加载器


```python
loader = CouchbaseLoader(
    connection_string,
    db_username,
    db_password,
    query,
)
```

您可以通过调用加载器的`load`方法来获取文档。它将返回一个包含所有文档的列表。如果您想避免此阻塞调用，可以调用返回迭代器的`lazy_load`方法。


```python
docs = loader.load()
print(docs)
```

The rooms take one back in time to the original styles and designs of the 1800\'s. A real connection to local residents, the 905 is a regular tour stop and the oldest hotel in the French Quarter. My wife and I prefer to stay in the first floor rooms where there is a sitting room with TV, bedroom, bath and kitchen. The kitchen has a stove and refrigerator, sink, coffeemaker, etc. Plus there is a streetside private entrance (very good security system) and a covered balcony area with seating so you can watch passersby.

You might not need it at the 905 but it\'s a necessity it if you stay on or near Bourbon Street, which is very loud all the time. Parking tips: You can park right in front to unload and it\'s only a couple blocks to the secure riverfront parking area. Plus there are several public parking lots nearby. My strategy is to get there early, unload, and drive around for a while near the hotel. It\'s not too hard to find a parking place but be careful about where it is. Stay away from corner spots since streets are narrow and delivery trucks don\'t have the room to turn and they will hit your car. Take note of the signs.

Even if you don\'t get a ticket make sure to go online to N.O. traffic ticket site to check your license number for violations.
