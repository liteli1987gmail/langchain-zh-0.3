# Zep
> 回忆、理解并提取聊天历史中的数据。为个性化的AI体验提供动力。

> [Zep](https://www.getzep.com) 是一个用于AI助手应用的长期记忆服务。
> 使用Zep，您可以为AI助手提供回忆过去对话的能力，无论距离多远，
> 同时减少幻觉、延迟和成本。

> 对Zep Cloud感兴趣吗？请查看 [Zep Cloud安装指南](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) 和 [Zep Cloud向量存储示例](https://help.getzep.com/langchain/examples/vectorstore-example)

## 开源安装和设置

> Zep开源项目: [https://github.com/getzep/zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep)
>
> Zep开源文档: [https://docs.getzep.com/](https://docs.getzep.com/)

您需要使用 `pip install -qU langchain-community` 安装 `langchain-community` 才能使用此集成

## 用法

在下面的示例中，我们使用了 Zep 的自动嵌入功能，该功能会自动在 Zep 服务器上嵌入文档
使用低延迟嵌入模型。

## 注意
- 这些示例使用 Zep 的异步接口。通过去掉方法名称中的 `a` 前缀来调用同步接口。
- 如果您传入一个 `Embeddings` 实例，Zep 将使用此实例来嵌入文档，而不是自动嵌入它们。
您还必须将文档集合设置为 `isAutoEmbedded === false`。
- 如果您将集合设置为 `isAutoEmbedded === false`，则必须传入一个 `Embeddings` 实例。

## 从文档加载或创建集合
