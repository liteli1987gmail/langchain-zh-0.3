# Google Jobs

本笔记本介绍如何使用 Google Jobs 工具获取当前的职位发布。

首先，您需要在以下网址注册一个 `SerpApi key`：https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up。

然后您必须使用以下命令安装 `google-search-results`：
`pip install google-search-results`

然后您需要将环境变量 `SERPAPI_API_KEY` 设置为您的 `SerpApi key`。

如果您没有，可以在 https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up 注册一个免费账户，并在这里获取您的 API 密钥： https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key。


如果您使用的是 conda 环境，可以在内核中使用以下命令进行设置：
conda activate [您的环境名称]
conda env config vars SERPAPI_API_KEY='[您的 serp api 密钥]'
